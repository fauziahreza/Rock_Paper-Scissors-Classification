# Rock-Paper-Scissors Classification

This is a rock-paper-scissors classification project using deep learning with TensorFlow, which is a submission for the "Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula" (Learn Machine Learning for Beginners) course by Dicoding.

## Description
This project aims to train a deep learning model to recognize hand images displaying the rock, paper, and scissors signs. The model will be trained using data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator` in TensorFlow.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Rock Paper Scissors Dataset (https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip). The dataset consists of hand images showing the rock, paper, and scissors signs.

The dataset consists of 2 main folders:

- The `train` folder: contains images for model training.
- The `val` folder: contains images for model validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
